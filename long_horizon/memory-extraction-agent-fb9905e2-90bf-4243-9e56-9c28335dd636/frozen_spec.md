# Frozen Spec (Session memory-extraction-agent-fb9905e2-90bf-4243-9e56-9c28335dd636)

## Task Definition
# TASK: ROLLOUT ANALYSIS

## OBJECTIVE: CONSTRUCT JSON OBJECT {raw_memory, rollout_summary, rollout_slug}

### INPUT: ROLLOUT CONTEXT

- rollout_path: agent-fb9905e2-90bf-4243-9e56-9c28335dd636
- rollout_cwd: /Users/harshitduggal/workspace/sapphire-cli

### INPUT: CONVERSATION DATA (FILTERED RESPONSE ITEMS)

STATUS: done
SUMMARY: I have completed a comprehensive analysis of the sapphire-cli codebase to understand its architecture, orchestration logic, and tooling as required by the frozen spec. Key components identified include the TUI layer (Charm Bubble Tea), the agent orchestration system (explicit sub-agent lifecycle, worktrees, mailbox), and the persistent memory system (SQLite, FTS5). I have reviewed the existing AGENTS.md and verified my understanding against the frozen spec constraints. No open questions remain.
PROGRESS: Codebase structure, core logic, orchestration, and memory systems analyzed; existing documentation reviewed; understanding verified.
FILES: none
COMMANDS: none
RISKS: none
NEXT: Proceed to update AGENTS.md with the gathered intelligence.
BLOCKERS: none
